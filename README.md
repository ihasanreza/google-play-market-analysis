# The Project
Gaining insights into the Android app market by using scrapedÂ Google Play Store data. ðŸ“±

Mobile apps are widely available. They are simple to createÂ and can be profitable. These two reasons have led to an increase in the number of apps being created. In this study, I compared 10,000+ apps in Google Play from various categories to conduct a thorough analysis of the Android app industry. The Kaggle [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lava18/google-play-store-apps) for this project was scraped from the Google Play website.
